This is a very leak distribution of Switch; it includes the absolute minimum code for this project.
Eventually, we plan to OSS all Switch. Switch is similar in scope and goals to Facebook's Folly library.

Most of the methods and datastructures here are either wrappers for STL equivalent classes/functions, or are very trimmed down constructs written so that this project can be compiled with them.
